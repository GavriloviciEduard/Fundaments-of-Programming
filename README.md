Numeric arrays

A math teacher needs a program to help students test different number properties. The
program manages an array of numbers and allows students to use the following features
offered by the program:

1. Add numbers in the array
o add 123 – add 123 as the last element of the array
o insert 123 at 1 – insert number 123 at index 1; the index of the first element is 0

2. Modify elements in the array
o remove 1 – removes the element at index 1
o remove from 1 to 3 – removes the elements at indices 1, 2 and 3
o replace 1 3 5 with 5 3 – replaces all sub-arrays 1 3 5 with 5 3

3. Print the numbers that have certain properties
o prime from 1 to 5 – print the prime numbers from the array found at indices 1..5
o odd from 1 to 5 – print the odd numbers from the array found at indices 1..5

4. Obtain different characteristics from sub-arrays
o sum from 1 to 5 – print the sum of elements 1..5
o gcd from 1 to 5 – print the greatest common divisor of elements 1..5
o max from 1 to 5 – print the maximum of elements 1..5

5. Filter values
o filter prime – keep only prime numbers, remove the other elements
o filter negative – keep only negative numbers, remove the other elements

6. Undo
o undo – undo the last operation that modified the array
